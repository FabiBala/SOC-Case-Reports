🛡️ SOC Investigation Case Reports
==================================

A collection of hands-on Security Operations Center (SOC) Tier 1 investigation reports. This repository documents the end-to-end lifecycle of security incidents—from initial alert triage to evidence-based analysis and final remediation.

📖 Overview
-----------

Each report in this repository represents a deep-dive analysis of a specific security event. The goal of these documents is to demonstrate a structured analytical mindset and technical proficiency in identifying real-world threats.

**Every report follows a standardized 4-step workflow:**

1.  **Detection & Triage**: Analyzing the initial SIEM/EDR alert.
    
2.  **Evidence Collection**: Investigating logs, network traffic (PCAP), and endpoint behavior.
    
3.  **Analysis & Pivot**: Correlating data with Threat Intelligence (OSINT).
    
4.  **Resolution**: Classifying the event (True/False Positive) and suggesting containment.
